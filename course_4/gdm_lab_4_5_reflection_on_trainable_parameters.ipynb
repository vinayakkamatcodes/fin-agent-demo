Since there are `num_heads` this means that the overall dimension of the projections across all heads is `embedding_dim / num_heads * num_heads = embedding_dim`. So for the purpose of computing the number of parameters, you may assume that there is only a single attention head that projects everything to a dimension `embedding_dim`.\n",
